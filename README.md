# Calendar events register

## User stories

I am organising multiple events and would like to streamline the process of event creation,
participant registration, and checking participation status.

- As an event organiser, I would like to create new events, so that participants can register
  for them.
- As a participant, I would like to register for an event, so that I can attend it.
- As an event organiser, I would like to see a list of all participants for a specific event, so I
  can manage attendance.
- As a participant, I would like to see all events I am registered for, so I can keep track of
  my schedule.
- As an event organiser, I would like to limit the number of participants for an event, so
  that events do not exceed capacity.
